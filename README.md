Sustainability Tracker

Project Overview
The Sustainability Tracker is a command-line application created as part of a university project to help users track their recycling and energy consumption. The goal of the project is to encourage responsible behavior towards sustainability, supporting the achievement of SDG-12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). Users can track their weekly recycling efforts, monitor energy usage, and evaluate their overall progress with a scoring system.

This project was developed as part of Programming Techniques II at University Technology Malaysia in Semester 2/Year 1.

Features
Track recycling efforts by entering the weight of glass, paper, and plastic recycled weekly.
Monitor electric and water consumption through monthly bill records.
Receive weekly sustainability tips to improve your eco-friendly habits.
Calculate and evaluate your Contribution Score based on recycling and energy consumption.
Track your consistency with a weekly streak tracker and unlock achievements.
Technologies Used
C++ – Core programming language
Standard Library – For input/output, vector, and string manipulations
Random Number Generation – For weekly tips
University Context
This project is developed as part of my university studies in the Computer Science at University Technology Malaysia. It serves as a practical application of various software engineering principles, including object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, and real-world application design. The project aims to promote sustainability and raise awareness about the impact of individual actions on the environment.
