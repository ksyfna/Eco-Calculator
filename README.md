# Sustainability Tracker

A command-line tool to track your recycling and energy consumption to promote **sustaible living**. This project was created for my **University Project** to raise awareness and contribute to **SDG-12** (Responsible Consumption and Production).

## Project Overview
The **Sustainability Tracker** allows users to track their weekly recycling efforts (glass, paper, plastic), energy consumption (electric & water bills), and overall enviromental contribution score.

## Features
- Track **weekly reccycling** for **glass**, **paper**, and **plastic**.
- Record **electric and water bills** for energy  consumption tracking.
- Get ***weekly sustaibility tips** to improve your habits.
- Calculate and track your **Contribution Score**.
- Maintain a **weekly streak** and unlock achievements for consistency.

## Technologies Used:
- **C++ :** Core programming language
- **Standard Library :** For input/output and string manipulation.
- **Random Number Generation :**  For weekly tips
 
## University Context
This project is developed as part as my university studeie in the Computer Science at University Technology Malaysia. It serves as practical application of various software engineering princiiples, including object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, and real-world application design. The project aims to promote sustaibility and raise awareness about impact of individual actions on the enviroment.
